# C++ Color Now

## Description

My program is supposed to prompt the user to input a color, the program then should diplay that color and ask if the color being displayed is the one the user wanted. If its the right color and the user had no issues seeing the color, the program should give the user the option to either try a new color or end the program. If the user has problems seeing the displayed color the program should then save that color to the users Color Now profile, where it would record/hold any of the colors the user is having trouble with. Then at the end use that profile to determine weather or not the user is coloblind and if so what kind of colorblindness they may have.

### Variables and Data Types

The data types that were used in the program were `int`,`char`,`bool`,and `string`. Each of these data types I used to hold the users input. The variables that I used when naming them I kept the names simple so their meaning would be easier to comprehend while going through the code.

### Input and Output

The way I want the program to run I feel like the input is just as important if not more important than the output because the users input in the program will ultimately decide what will be outputed.

### Decisions

I feel like the decisions that I made with my code are somewhat on the right path, but obviously I still need to add a lot of code to the program. A point of confusion is how I would get the program to display the color that the user inputed, and then store that color if it was incorrect. 

### Iteration

In the program iteration can be seen when the `do while` loop is used or when an `if` statement is utilized, I used these functions becasue I felt that they were appropriate to use given the circumstances that I needed/used them in.

### File Input and Output

There is no file input and output in my program yet. I plan to add it hence the users Color Now profile I just need to figure out a way where I can prompt the user to name the file and start adding any colors the user is having trouble with.
