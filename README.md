### Variables and Data Types

The data types I used in the program were: `int` and declared them in the program as `R,G,B`. I also used `string` declaring it as `p1,p2,p3`

### Input and Output

The `cout` statements are not being printed out into the program also not allowing for the rest of the `cin` statements to be printed out. Which assigns vaules to the variables.

### Decisions

The decision construct that I made was uneffective and was not written out properly.

### Iteration

No iteration was used in my code but I do know for the program it will be useful to have a `for` loop and possibly a `do while` loop.

### File Input and Output

The way I wrote the code it wont print what I want it to so i cant get any input.
